       <h2>American Short Hair<h2>
         <p>My favorite kind of cat is the American Short Hair cat because this is the breed my cat (Maverick) is. This cat is descended
           from European cats that were brought along on boats for pest control. It is the 7th most popular cat in America.</p>

       <h2>Bengal Cat</h2>
         <p>The Bengal cat is another popular breed that has been purposely bred to look like the wild Asian Leopard. This results in
           a friendly domestic cat that has the vivid markings of a leopard.</p>
